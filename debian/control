Description: Comprehensive password hashing framework
 Passlib is a password hashing library for Python 3, which provides
 cross-platform implementations of over 30 password hashing algorithms,
 as well as a framework for managing existing password hashes. It's
 designed to be useful for a wide range of tasks, from verifying a hash
 found in /etc/shadow, to providing full-strength password hashing for
 multi-user application.
